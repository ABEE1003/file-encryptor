# file encryptor 
This project is a file encryptor in c++ language. My c++ program showcases expertise in encryption ,fortifying digital infrastructures for confidentiality ,integrity and availability of critical information assets.  such as Bank details ,Gpay passwords, and card details.This project has crucial role in the domain of cyber security and analysis.This program prevents various cyber threats such as unauthorised access to personal details, dumpster diving,and so on . 
           File encryption works through the use of complex algorithms. An encrypted file is one that has had an encoding algorithm applied to it to scramble the data. The file becomes unreadable once scrambled, but the effect is only temporary. The encrypted data comes with a key the sender provides. This key usually takes the form of a password or passphrase, such as a string of alphanumeric digits, which enables decryption. Only individuals authorized to access the data receive the decryption key. Once the authorized recipient enters the correct password or passphrase, the file becomes readable again. Most operating systems and file systems have support for file encryption built in. The system safely stores sensitive files, and the decryption key provides access to them.
